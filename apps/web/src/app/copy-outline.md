# Positioning Framework

## Core Elements

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Core Benefit** | Turn any private data into instant context for the LLM you already use. |
| **Competitive Edge** | Open-source code, self-host or cloud, pay-as-you-grow; no lock-in like Carbon.ai or other closed RAG tools. |
| **Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP)** | 1. **AI Agencies & Boutiques** – build custom Gen-AI apps for enterprise clients but lack time to run their own RAG infra.<br>2. **SaaS & Platform Engineers** – need a plug-in RAG layer to add "search my data" to an existing product.<br>3. **Enterprise RevOps / Sales Enablement Teams** – want insights from thousands of sales calls and docs without shipping data to a black-box vendor. |

## Primary Use-Case Clusters

### Sales Call Intelligence
Upload Zoom/Gong recordings → auto-chunk, embed, and retrieve → ask "What objections came up this week?"

### Customer-Support Copilot
Pipe Zendesk + Confluence docs → chatbot answers with real policy text, cuts handle time.

### Internal Knowledge Search
Legal, HR or policy PDFs ingested once → staff ask secure questions in Slack.

### Product Help Widgets
Sync docs repo → serve contextual answers inside your app.

# Website Structure & Copy

## Hero Section

| Part | Draft Copy |
|------|------------|
| **Headline** | Bring Your Own Data to Any LLM—Instant RAG API |
| **Sub-headline** | Ingest calls, docs, or tickets in minutes and retrieve laser-accurate context at query time. Open-source, scalable, and ready for production. |

## Use-Case Blocks

| Title | Short Description (≤ 25 words) |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| **Sales Call Insights** | Drop your meeting transcripts; ask "Where did pricing objections spike?" and get timestamped clips plus summarised answers you can paste into CRM. |
| **Support Knowledge Copilot** | Connect Zendesk, Notion, or Confluence. Agents type a question and receive citations from the latest docs—no more tab-switching. |
| **Internal Policy Q&A** | Keep legal or HR PDFs on-prem. Employees query through Slack, results reference exact clauses—no risk of leaking data. |
| **Developer Docs Search** | Sync your docs repo hourly. Ship an AI search bar that returns code snippets and links in under 300 ms. |

*Each block: 1-sentence pain, 1-sentence outcome. No fluff.*

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Add a "5-line curl" snippet** under the hero to prove dev-friendliness.
2. **Show logos of at least three paying teams** (if allowed) beside the stats for faster trust.
3. **Put monthly price equivalents in parentheses** to remove friction.
4. **Raise contrast on your stats section** so 500+, 200k+ numbers pop.
5. **Add an SEO text block near footer**: "Open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform built on Supabase row-level security" to lock key phrases.

**These moves tighten the story around one clear promise**: Supavec is the fastest route to secure, production-grade RAG for any LLM.
