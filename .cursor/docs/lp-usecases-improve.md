Quick take

The section does pop, but because each card uses a different pastel-tint background it also becomes the only place on the page with multiple brand-agnostic colors. On an otherwise white page with a single purple accent (the hero orb + buttons), that patchwork can feel a bit ‚Äúrainbow‚Äù and slightly at odds with the calm, minimal vibe you‚Äôve been going for.

What works

üëç	Why it‚Äôs good
Immediate visual break	The soft color tiles pull the eye, so visitors won‚Äôt miss the Use-Cases block.
Pastel tints (not saturated)	You‚Äôve avoided loud primaries, so it isn‚Äôt garish.
Consistent layout	Same card size, screenshot-top / label-bottom keeps things tidy.


‚∏ª

Where it starts to feel ‚Äútoo colorful‚Äù
	1.	Four unrelated hues side-by-side (blue, pink, mint, grey) read as decorative rather than brand-driven.
	2.	The pastel fill already competes with the hero orb gradient, giving the page two different focal color families.
	3.	Extra micro-icons inside each card add more colors, amplifying the effect.

Tweaks to keep it eye-catching and on-brand

Option	How	Result
Unify on a single brand tint	Pick a 5-10% tint of your main brand color (e.g., the Supavec purple) for all cards.	Keeps the visual break while staying on palette.
Brand-accent stripe	Make the card itself white, but add a 4-6 px colored top border (different hue per use case or all purple).	Lets you keep color cues with much lighter footprint.
Tone down saturation	Reduce current pastels ~30 % lightness, 15 % saturation.	Still differentiated but calmer; lower contrast with white page.
Use icons, not fills, for variety	Cards stay white; each use case gets a colored corner badge or icon.	Focus is on content; color becomes a subtle label, not the background.


‚∏ª

Extra polish
	‚Ä¢	Accessible contrast ‚Äì keep text on pastel backgrounds ‚â• 4.5:1; lightening the fills helps.
	‚Ä¢	Consistent shadow / border radius ‚Äì subtle shadows will separate the cards from the white canvas even if you drop the colored backgrounds.
	‚Ä¢	Mobile ‚Äì make sure the pastel blocks don‚Äôt stack into a long rainbow strip on small screens; consider removing tint below a certain breakpoint.

TL;DR

It looks engaging, but four distinct background colors introduce a second color scheme that slightly conflicts with the rest of the minimalist page. Unifying the cards around a single brand tint (or using neutral cards with a colored accent) will keep the section eye-catching without feeling visually noisy.
