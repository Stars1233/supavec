---

## 1. Hero

| Component       | Copy (first-draft)                                                                                                             | Notes                                                                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Headline**    | “Turn Every Sales Call Into a Playbook-Ready Brief—Automatically.”                                                            | Directly states benefit; speaks to process improvement (calls → actionable brief).         |
| **Sub-headline**| “Upload a Zoom or Fireflies transcript and, in seconds, Supavec surfaces wins, objections, next steps, and coaching cues—so your agency spends more time closing and less time replaying recordings.” | Highlights speed, supported sources, and main value props (insight + time savings).        |
| **Primary CTA** | “See a 3-Min Demo”                                                                                                             | Keeps promise small; suits busy agency leaders.                                             |
| **Secondary CTA**| “Run My Transcript Free”                                                                                                      | Low-commitment proof; anchors the promise.                                                  |
| **Hero Visual** | Split screen: left—snippet of messy transcript; right—clean one-page brief with color-tagged insights.                        | Make the transformation instantly clear.                                                    |

## 2. Pain ↔ Promise (“Why This Page Exists”)

- **Pain Points** for B2B sales agencies:
  - Managers binge-watching midnight Zoom replays  
  - Reps missing coaching while quota clock ticks  
  - Ops teams drowning in call data but lacking synthesis

- **Promise**:  
  > “Supavec gives every call a coach’s summary—no extra headcount.”

---

## 3. How Supavec Works (3-Step Visual)

1. **Ingest** – Drop in a `.vtt` / `.srt` or connect Fireflies API.  
2. **Chunk & Retrieve** – Supavec’s open-source RAG slices by speaker, batches turns, indexes instantly.  
3. **Summarize & Coach** – LLM generates a one-page brief (wins, objections, next steps, sentiment, talk-ratio).

_Use icons or minimalist illustrations for each step._

## 4. Outcome-Focused Benefits

| For             | Outcome                            | Proof Point You Can Quantify                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Agency Owners   | 15% faster pipeline reviews        | Quote or mini-case once you have it           |
| Sales Managers  | 3× more coaching touchpoints/week  | Internal benchmark or early user              |
| Reps            | Clear next-step checklist post-call| Demo GIF of checklist export                  |

_Keep language concrete (time saved, calls handled, coaching sessions)._

---

## 5. Integrations & Workflow Fit

**Logo grid**: Zoom, Fireflies, Gong (roadmap), HubSpot  
_Text_:  
> “Supavec slots into the tooling you already use—no platform migration required.”

---

## 6. Live Demo / Interactive Widget (Optional)

Embed a mini-widget allowing visitors to paste a short sample transcript and watch the brief appear.  
_(Blur sensitive words. A GIF loop works if true interactivity is heavy.)_

---

## 7. Social Proof (“Built for Agencies Like Yours”)

- 1–2 short testimonials from pilot agencies  
- Pull-quotes over faces + agency logos  
- If no testimonials: include a **“Founding Partner Program”** badge offering white-glove onboarding

---

## 8. Open-Source & Privacy Edge

> “Supavec is MIT-licensed and can run in your own VPC—so client data never leaves your walls.”

**Key Points**:
- Self-host option  
- Auditability  
- No vendor lock-in  

---

## 9. Pricing Snapshot

Even if full pricing is elsewhere, show a simple matrix for agency-relevant tiers (e.g., pay-per-transcript or per-seat) to **pre-qualify leads**.

---

## 10. FAQ (Targeted)

- “How accurate are the summaries?”  
- “Can it detect multiple speakers?”  
- “How do we ingest calls at scale?”  
- “What languages are supported?”

_Keep answers crisp; link to full docs._

---

## 11. Secondary CTA Footer

_Re-state core benefit_ + two buttons:  
- **Run My Transcript**  
- **Book Demo**
