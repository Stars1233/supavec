# Supavec Landing Page Improvements

Below is a punch-list of improvements, grouped by Conversion, Copy & Content, Visual / UX, and Technical / SEO. Skim the headers first, then cherry-pick the items that resonate.

## 1. Conversion Boosters (highest impact)

| Area | Issue | Suggested Fix |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Above-the-fold trust | No immediate proof that agencies already use Supavec | Add a slim "Trusted by" bar (3â€“5 small logos or first-name/agency badges) directly under the CTAs. |
| Primary CTA clarity | Two CTAs ("3-min demo" and "Run my transcript") feel equal weight â‡’ choice paralysis | a) Make one the primary (high-contrast button) and the other a ghost link.<br>b) Label with an outcome: "Get 3-min Demo" â†’ "Watch 3-min Demo" / "Run Free Transcript" â†’ "Generate My Free Brief". |
| Micro-conversion | No email capture for lukewarm visitors | Between Painâ†”Promise and 3-Step Process, embed a light "ROI Calculator" form (email + avg. calls per week) â†’ instant savings estimate. |
| Social proof depth | Testimonials are generic | Swap placeholders for short, numbers-anchored quotes ("Supavec cut review time from 40 min to 8 min per call" â€“ Sarah, RevOps Lead @ XYZ). Faces > logos > text-only. |
| Pricing scent | Zero hint of cost | Even a "Starts at $XX / 100 calls" anchor price filters tire kickers and stops hidden-price anxiety. |

## 2. Copy & Content Tweaks

| Section | Observation | Improvement |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Headline | Strong, but could speak to agency persona | "Turn Every Client Call Into a Playbook-Ready Briefâ€”Automatically." |
| Sub-headline | Mentions Zoom & Fireflies, nice. Missing the open-source/privacy hook | Append: "All powered by our open-source RAG engineâ€”deploy in your own VPC or use ours." |
| Pain column | Bullets use full sentences; skimmability suffers | Convert to "emoji/ icon + 4-6 words" (e.g., ðŸ“‰ "Manager binge-watching replays" ). |
| Promise column | Copy OK, lacks specificity | Add 1 data point: "One-page summary in < 30 sec." |
| Result cards | Placeholder metrics (24 s / 95 % / 3Ã—) look random | Back them with footnote (+link) to a short methodology blog or pilot data. |
| Founding Partner Program | Nice, but buried | Pull it up right after "Trusted by leaders" as a solution for FOMO: "Only 9 spots left". |
| FAQ | Good spread; add one on white-label / client brandingâ€”agencies will ask. | |

## 3. Visual / UX Polish

1. **Hero visual** â€“ Consider a subtle auto-play toggle: 3-second loop that flicks between the raw transcript and the color-coded brief, reinforcing "before â†’ after" without requiring scroll.

2. **3-Step icons** â€“ Use sequential numbering circles (1-2-3) to guide the eye; current icons are colored but not ordered.

3. **Integrations bar** â€“ Add a "Coming soon" pill on logos in roadmap to set expectations (e.g., Gong, Chorus).

4. **Section dividers** â€“ The faint grey lines work, but alternating very light grey / white section backgrounds improves scannability.

5. **Sticky nav CTA** â€“ On scroll, morph the nav bar into a slim strip with a single "Get Demo" button to catch exit intent.

## 4. Technical & SEO

| Item | Why it matters | Quick Win |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | Above-the-fold hero image may be >150 kB | Convert to WebP & lazy-load anything below the fold. |
| Schema markup | FAQ & How-To schema boosts SERP visibility | Add FAQPage & SoftwareApplication structured data. |
| Alt & aria labels | Accessibility & SEO | Provide descriptive alt tags for the transcript/brief image ("Screenshot showing call transcript converted into coaching brief"). |
| Meta title / description | Not shown in screenshot | Use primary keyword: "AI Sales Call Coaching for Agencies â€“ Supavec". |
| Viewport animations | If using heavy JS for counters/accordion, throttle or use CSS-only where possible. | |

## 5. Extras to Consider (road-map, not must-do today)

- **Interactive sandbox** â€“ Let visitors paste 2â€“3 sentences and see a mini-brief inline. The dopamine hit drives sign-ups.
- **ROI white-paper** â€“ "How a 15-seat agency regained 12 hrs/week with AI-powered call briefs" (PDF lead magnet).
- **RevOps playbook template** â€“ Free Notion or Google Doc; exchange email â†’ pipeline fuel.
- **Video testimonial** â€“ 45-second Loom from a pilot manager beats paragraphs of text.

## TL;DR (if you only tackle three things)

1. **Add instant credibility** at the very top (logos, single primary CTA, pilot numbers).
2. **Inject real data** (processing speed, time saved) and reference source.
3. **Create a micro-interactive moment** (ROI calc or brief generator) to move visitors from passive scroll to active lead.

Knock those out, and the page will feel sharper, more trustworthy, and laser-aligned with B2B sales agencies' buying triggers.
